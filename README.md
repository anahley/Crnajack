# Crnajack

Crnajack!


It's "simple" because there are mechanics like insurance that I didn't add. Only the simple, base game is present. You either hit or stand, and you want to get closer to 21 than the computer (dealer) without going over. You can press the "reset" button if you want to play another round of Crnajack.

This game is meant to be played by anyone interested.
This is a game made by me, Alec, a student at the EPHS, during my IOS Development course.
